# College Simulator

Test it out at https://college-simulator.vercel.app/

The College Decision Portal Simulator allows users to create a realistic college admissions decision experience.

The app does not calculate admission chances or evaluate applications. It focuses solely on simulating what an applicant sees after decisions are released.

Users can create a fictional college, enter applicant information, select a decision round, and choose an outcome such as accepted, rejected, or deferred. The app then generates a realistic admissions portal view and decision letter based on those selections.

All schools, applicants, and decisions are fictional and for simulation purposes only. The app is not affiliated with any real college or university and should not be used as an admissions predictor.
